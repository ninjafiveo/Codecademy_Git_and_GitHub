Hello Git
Git is a software that allows you to keep track of changes made to a project over time. Git works by recording the changes you make to a project, storing those changes, then allowing you to reference them as needed.

We’ll learn Git by using it to help us write a screenplay called Harry Programmer and the Sorcerer’s Code.

We’ll get started by taking a look at the screenplay project.
